                                Ahoj!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As if it wasn't already obvious, my name is Irina and I'm currently a student at the Faculty of Computer Science in Iasi, Romania.
                                Long story short, I've always been super passionate about visual arts! I adore painting, illustrating,
                                creating beautiful content... basically anything that inspires people around me! ‚úçüèª 
                                Coding is just my way of building tiny spectacular worlds. üåç
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The thing with me is... I'm a boss. The classic commander personality type, yes, that's me! But I love learning
                                and I love the people around me and so I've learnt to see the beauty of the fact that, well, we're all different... fortunately!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm currently dedicating my "free" time to developing projects with a higher impact on people's lives.
                                (One thing I'm working on right now is my cool bachelor degree project - hint: it involves Unity and VR).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Oh, by the way, outside of visuals, I'm also a badminton player on a daily basis üè∏, a plant lady üåª and a foodie üçù!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Get in touch with me and let's build something crazy awesome!
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="values">
                        <div class="text_wrap"> 
                            <h2> ... and my values </h2>
                            <h4 class="value_item">
                                <mark> üôèüèª kindness </mark>
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Stay humble and be kind to everyone around you. You can never really know what someone's been through, neither
                                whether you're gonna need that someone at some point of your life or not.
                                So give unconditional help, even when you're not explicitely asked. Get involved.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="value_item">

                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Super hard work is important, totally, but I think it's just as relevant knowing when to stop, take a break and
                                connect with what's around you. We ain't no robots after all!
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="value_item">

                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                If it doesn't inspire you to grow, then it's a no. If you're not enjoying what you do - then move. Focus on something
                                you believe in, something that challanges you to always give and learn more. People included.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="value_item">

                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Stay true to yourself and be honest about it. Don't be afraid to admit when there's something you don't know yet,
                                neither when you're wrong. Avoid getting involved in things that don't match with your principles or desires.
