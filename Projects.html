                <img src='./Mockup/17.png' alt="TeVi Illustration">
                <p> TeVi is a flexible Web data visualizer regarding worldwide terrorism, based on our own RESTful API.
                    The statistics, views and maps can be exported as PNG, SVG, JPG, PDF, CSV, XLSX, HTML and JSON and
                    the charts have been done using amCharts.
                    The system offers support for multi-criterial search of reported incidents,
                    including details from other external resources (i.e. Kaggle). Its purpose is to both help
                    specialists
                    and inform the public regarding terrorist attacks from the past 50 years. *Project done in collaboration
                    with Victor-Ionut Platon and Bogdan Peltea.

                <p>
                    Chessy Chess is, as intuitive as it sounds, a game of chess (although not necessarily conventional).
                    It consists of 3 main modules: backend, frontend and network connectivity. Using mainly C++ with
                    SQLite and some Qt libraries,
                    it was written under Linux to connect to a chess server which supports any number of simultaneous
                    matches.
                    The full documentation regarding the implementation and other details can be found <a
                        href="ChessyReference.pdf" target="_blank"> here </a>.
                    *Project done in collaboration with Stefan Moisanu on the server side.

                <p> CatanWorld is a model for the traditional Catan Game, built in Unity using C#. It's integrated with Firebase Authentification
                    and it makes use of an object-oriented database. This version supports concurrent matches of 3 players and also provides a built-in
                    chat and other specific functionalities, such as: roads, settlements, cities, harbours, options for trading, tutorials, development cards buying & usage,
                    isometric view, camera control, sound & resolution settings and so on. *Project done for the Software Engineering lab

                <img src='./Mockup/5.png' alt="ZeN Illustration">
                <p>
                    ZeN meant designing an original programming language and providing a syntactic analyzer for it,
                    using YACC.
                    The language includes various features, such as predefined types (int, float, char, string, bool),
                    as well as user
                    defined data types (like classes), array types, variable&constant declarations/definition,
                    control statements, assignment statements, arithmetic and boolean expressions,
                    operations with string types, function calls with different types of parameters and so on.
                    The header, written in C, is responsible for assuring the semantic analysis, checking different
                    properties (i.e.
                    if any variable that appears in a program has been previously defined - or if it's been declared
                    more times, if a function
                    is not defined more than once with the same signature, if the parameters of a function call have the
                    same type as they are supposed to etc.).
                    It also provides a symbol table and a function table, both containing the specific information.

                <img src='./Mockup/4.png' alt="Impass Illustration">
                <p>
                    Impass is a very dear project to me, because it was the first one I'd ever done until then and, I'm
                    not gonna lie, there's a lot of spaghetti code there!
                    To sum up, Impass is a logical boardgame, available both in a singleplayer and a multiplayer
                    version. It also has 2 options
                    when it comes to the visual part - a modern theme and a classic, "1975", theme. The trick here lies
                    in the "computer's game" and
                    it was not that easy to think of designing a good version for it. *Project done in collaboration
                    with Bogdan Peltea,
                    my dear and hardworking colleague.
